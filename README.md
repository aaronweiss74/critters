# Critters #
Critters is a modern [Creatures 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatures_(artificial_life_program)) clone that seeks to be cleanly designed, cross-platform, and easily extensible. It's built using SFML, OpenGL, and C++11. The game is intended to be closer in appearance to the original 2D games than the new, upcoming Creatures 4 game.
